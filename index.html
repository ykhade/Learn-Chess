        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Chess is believed to have been invented 1500 years ago in India. The game has changed only slightly since
                then with the advent of the queen in the 15th century and some minor movement adjustments in the
                1800s.</p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The ultimate aim in the chess game is delivering a checkmate – trapping your opponent´s king. When you
                have him attacked and he can no longer escape, it's called "checkmate," and you win.</p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Rules">
        <article>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>White is always first to move and players take turns alternately moving one piece at a time. Movement is
                required. If a player´s turn is to move, he is not in check but has no legal moves, this situation is
                called
                “Stalemate” and it ends the game in a draw.</p>

            <p>Each type of piece has its own method of movement. A piece may be moved to another position or may
                capture
                an opponent´s piece, replacing on its square (en passant being the only exception). With the exception
                of
                the knight, a piece may not move over or through any of the other pieces.</p>

            <p>When a king is threatened with capture (but can protect himself or escape), it´s called check. If a king
                is
                in check, then the player must make a move that eliminates the threat of capture and cannot leave the
                king
                in check.</p>

            <p>Checkmate happens when a king is placed in check and there is no legal move to escape. Checkmate ends the
                game and the side whose king was checkmated looses. Chess for kids would be a great option to help the
                kid
                enhance his thinking capability with the chess strategies involved.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out so that each player has the white (or light)
                color square in the bottom right-hand side. The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time.
                The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to
                them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white
                queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square.</p>

            <h2>How the Pieces Move</h2>
            <p>Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces
                (though the knight can jump over other pieces), and can never move onto a square with one of their own
                pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured.
                Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their
                square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important
                squares in the game.</p>
            <h2>How the King Moves</h2>
            <p>The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king
                known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game.he king may never move himself into check
                (where he could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece this is called "check".</p>

            </code>
            <h2>How the Queen Moves</h2>
            <p>The queen is the most powerful piece.The queen moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal,
                vertical, or diagonal direction.as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own
                pieces. And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece her move is over.</p>
            <code>

                     alt="queen-board">
            </code>
            <h2>How the Rook Moves</h2>
            <p>The rook moves much like the queen: as far as it wants along straight lines, but only forward, backward,
                and to the sides (not diagonally).</p>
            <code>
                <img class="board"

                     alt="rook-board">
            </code>
            <h2>How the Bishop Moves</h2>
            <p>The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or
                dark) and must always stay on that color. Bishops work well together because they cover up each other's
                weaknesses.</p>

                     alt="bishop-board">
            </code>
            <h2>How the Knight Moves</h2>
            <p>Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces - going two squares in one direction, and then
                one more move at a 90 degree angle, just like the shape of an "L". Knights are also the only pieces that
                can move over other pieces. People often say knights "hop" because of that special ability.</p>

                     alt="knight-board">
            </code>
            <h2>How the Pawn Moves</h2>
            <p>Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward, but capture
                diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where
                they can move forward two squares. Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. They
                can never move or capture backwards. If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot
                move past or capture that piece.</p>

            <h2>Castling</h2>
            <p>One other special rule is called castling, the only time you can move two pieces in one move. This
                combination move allows you to do two important things all in one turn: get your king to safety
                (hopefully), and get your rook out of the corner and into the game. On a player's turn he may move his
                king two squares over to one side and then move the rook to the other side of his king. (See the example
                below.) In order to castle, however, the following conditions must be met:</p>
            <li>It must be that king’s very first move</li>
            <li>It must be that rook’s very first move</li>
            <li>There cannot be any pieces between the king and rook to move</li>
            <li>The king may not be in check or pass through check</li>

        <article>
            <h2>En Passant</h2>
            <p>The last rule about pawns is called “en passant,” which is French for “in passing”. If a pawn moves out
                two squares on its first move, and by doing so lands to the side of an opponent's pawn (effectively
                jumping past the other pawn's ability to capture it), that other pawn has the option of capturing the
                first pawn as it passes by. This special move must be done immediately after the first pawn has moved
                past, otherwise the option to capture it is no longer available. Click through the example below to
                better understand this odd, but important rule.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>Pawn Promotion</h2>
            <p>Pawns have another special ability and that is that if a pawn reaches the other side of the board it can
                become any other chess piece (called promotion). A pawn may be promoted to any piece. A common
                misconception is that pawns may only be exchanged for a piece that has been captured. That is NOT true.
                A pawn is usually promoted to a queen. Only pawns may be promoted.</p>
